# Customer_Behaviour_analysis
This is a complete data analytics project I built from scratch, where I analyze retail customer shopping trends using SQL, Python, and Power BI. I handled everything end-to-end — from cleaning and exploring the data to creating an interactive dashboard that highlights key insights and patterns in customer behaviour.
